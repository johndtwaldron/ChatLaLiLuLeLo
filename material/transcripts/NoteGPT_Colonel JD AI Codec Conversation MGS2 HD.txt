I will triumph over the Patriots and liberate us all and we will become the Sons of Liberty Ryden are you receiving we're still here how's that possible the AI was destroyed only GW who who are you to begin with we're not what you'd call human over the past 200 years a kind of Consciousness formed layer by layer in The Crucible of the White House it's not unlike the way life started in the oceans for billion years ago the White House was our primordial soup a base of evolution we are formless we are the very discipline and morality that Americans invoke so often how can anyone hope to eliminate us as long as this nation exists so will we cut the crap if


00:01:07
you're Immortal why would you take away individual freedoms and censor the net Jack don't be silly don't you know that our plans have your interests not ours in mind what Jack listen carefully like a good boy the mapping of the human genome was completed early this Century as a result the evolution evolutionary log of the human race lay open to us we started with genetic engineering and in the end we succeeded in digitizing life itself but there are things not covered by genetic information what do you mean human memories ideas culture history genes don't contain any record of human history is it something that should not be passed on should that information be left at the mercy of nature we've always kept records of Our Lives lives through words pictures symbols from tablets to books but not all the information was inherited by later generations a small


00:02:10
percentage of the whole was selected and processed then passed on not unlike genes really that's what history is Jack but in the current digitized world trivial information is accumulating every second preserved in all its tress never fading always accessible r about Petty issues misinterpretations slander all this junk data preserved in an unfiltered State growing at an alarming rate it will only slow down social progress reduce the rate of evolution R you seem to think that our plan is one of censorship are you telling me it's not you're being silly what we propose to do is not to control content but to create context create context the Digital Society furthers human flaws and selectively rewards development of convenient half truths just look at the strange jux depositions of morality around you billions spent on new weapons in order to humanely murder other humans


00:03:15
rights of criminals are given more respect than the privacy of their victims although there are people suffering in poverty huge donations are made to protect endangered species everyone grows up being told the same thing be nice to other people but beat out the competition you're special believe in yourself and you will succeed but it's obvious from the start that only a few can succeed you exercise your right to freedom and this is the result all rhetoric to avoid conflict and protect each other from hurt the untested truths spun by different interests continue to churn and accumulate in the sandbox of political correctness and value systems and everyone withdraws into their own small gated community afraid of a larger Forum they stay inside their little ponds leaking whatever truth suits them into the growing Cesspool of society at large the different Cardinal truths neither Clash nor mesh no one is invalidated but nobody is right not even natural


00:04:21
selection can take place here the world is being engulfed in truth and this is the way the world ends not with a bang but a wimp ER we're trying to stop that from happening it's our responsibility as rulers just as in genetics unnecessary information and memory must be filtered out to stimulate the evolution of the species and you think you're qualified to decide what's necessary and not absolutely who else could wait through the Sea of garbage you people produce retrieve valuable truths and even interpret their meaning for later generations that that's what it means to create context I'll decide for myself what to believe and what to pass on but is that even your own idea or something snake told you that's the proof of your incompetence right there you lack the qualifications to exercise Free Will that's not true I have the right does something like a self exist inside of


00:05:24
you that which you call Self serves as nothing more than a mask to cover your own being in this era of readymade truths self is just something used to preserve those positive emotions that you occasionally feel another possibility is that self is a concept you conveniently borrowed under the logic that would endow you with some sense of strength that's crap is it would you prefer that someone else tell you all right then explain it to him jack You're simply the best and you got there all by your yourself oh what happened do you feel lost why not try a bit of soul searching don't think you'll find anything though ironic that although self is something that you yourself fashioned every time something goes wrong you turn around and place the blame on something else it's not my fault it's not your fault in denial you simply resort to looking for


00:06:28
another more convenient truth truth in order to make yourself feel better leaving behind in an instant the so-called truth you once embraced should someone like that be able to decide what is truth should someone like you even have the right to decide you've done nothing but abuse your freedom you don't deserve to be free we're not the ones smothering the world you are the individual is supposed to be weak but far from powerless a single person has the potential to Ru in the world and the Agee of digitized communication has given even more power to the individual too much power for an immature species building a legacy involves figuring out what is wanted and what needs to be done for that goal all this you used to struggle with now we think for you we are your Guardians after all you want to control human thought human behavior of course anything can be Quantified IED nowadays that's what this exercise was


00:07:33
designed to prove you fell in love with me just as you were meant to after all isn't that right jack ocelot was not told the whole truth to say the least we rule an entire nation of what interest would a single soldier no matter how able be to us the S3 plan does not stand for Solid Snake simulation what it does stand for is selection for societal sanity the S3 is a system for controlling human will and Consciousness S3 is not you a soldier trained in the image of Solid Snake it is a method a protocol that created a circumstance that made you what you are so you see we're the S3 not you what you experienced was the final test


00:08:43
of its Effectiveness that's crazy you heard what President Johnson said the Arsenal's GW system is the key to their Supremacy the objective of this exercise was to establish such a method we used Shadow Moses as a paradigm for the exercise I wonder if you would have preferred a fantasy [Music] setting we chose that backdrop because of its extreme circumstances it was an optimal test for S3's crisis management capacity if the model could trigger control and solve this it would be ready for any contingency and now we have our proof Ryden there are also reasons behind your selection solidus raised plenty of other child soldiers you know why we chose you over them H it was because you were the


00:09:49
only one who refused to acknowledge the past all the others remember what they were and pay for it daily but you turn your back on everything you don't like like you do whatever you like see only the things you like and for yourself alone yes Rose can attest to that you refused to see me for what I was I lied to you but I wanted to be caught you pretended to be understanding to be a gentleman you never made a conscious attempt to reach out to me the only time you did was when I gave you no choice but to do so I was just trying not to what trying not to hurt me dear the one you were trying not to hurt was yourself avoiding the truth under the guise of kindness is all that you did it occurred to you to do nothing but look out for yourself even if you claim that it was for my sake that feeling was nowhere to be seen in the end everything was for your sake I was never part of the picture exactly right so you see you're a perfect representative of the masses


00:10:56
we need to protect this is why we chose you you accepted the fiction we've provided obeyed our orders and did everything you were told to the exercise is a resounding success didn't I tell you that GW was still incomplete but not anymore thanks to you your persona experiences triumphs and defeats are nothing but byproducts the real objective was ensuring that we could generate and manipulate them it's taken a lot of time and money but it was well worth it considering the results I think that's enough talk it's time for the final exercise Ryden take solidus down think again I'm through doing what I'm told oh really aren't you forgetting something if you die my child dies the termination of vital signals from your Nano machines means the death of Olga's child not to mention the death of rose Rose she's wired the same way


00:12:02
Rose does she actually exist of course I do Jack you have to believe damn it will be a fight to the death solidus at least wants you dead we will collect the necessary data from this last fight then we'll consider the exercise closed so Jack the Ripper will it be solidus the Patriots creation or you solidus is creation our beloved monsters enjoy yourselves
