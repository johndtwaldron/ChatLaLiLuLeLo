This is a placeholder for a codec-style icon file.
In practice, you would replace this with an actual .ico file with the MGS2 codec design.

The icon should feature:
- MGS2 codec communication interface styling
- Cyan/green color scheme matching the UI theme
- Professional appearance suitable for desktop launcher
- Multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256) for Windows compatibility

For now, the launcher will use the default PowerShell executable icon.
