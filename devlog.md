# ChatLaLiLuLeLo Development Log

## Session 1 - 2025-09-30T11:34:18Z

**Objective:** Initial project setup and basic UI components

**Key Decisions:**
- Clarified project focus: Entertainment app for MGS nostalgia and intellectual sparring (not AI assistant)
- Maintaining codename "ChatLaLiLuLeLo" for development
- Priority order: 1) Repo structure, 2) Gitpod setup, 3) Basic Codec UI components

**Progress:**
- [x] Create GitHub repo structure with Expo scaffold
- [x] Set up Gitpod development environment  
- [x] Implement basic Codec UI components
- [x] Create devlog file

**Components Created:**
- `CodecFrame`: Main container with scanlines, CRT glow, jitter animations
- `Portrait`: Animated character portraits with idle motion and mouth flaps
- `SubtitleStream`: Scrolling text with typewriter effect and blinking cursor
- `ChatScreen`: Demo screen combining all components
- `theme.ts`: Codec green color palette and styling constants

**Infrastructure:**
- Complete Expo project structure with TypeScript
- Babel config with module resolution for @/ imports
- ESLint configuration
- Gitpod cloud development environment
- Package.json with all necessary dependencies

**Next Steps:**
- Ready for git commit and repository creation
- Components demonstrate core codec aesthetic successfully
- Foundation ready for AI integration and conversation features
