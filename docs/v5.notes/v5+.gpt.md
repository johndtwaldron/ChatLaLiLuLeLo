ChatLaLiLuLeLo v5+ – Feature & Vision Roadmap

Near-Term v5 Goals

Hideo Kojima Easter Eggs

Triggered responses for specific phrases (“MGS2 was a good game” → play codec clip).

Audio hooks from material/audio (MP3/WAV).

Easter egg handler in backend prompts.

Dynamic Audio Integration

Extend startup animation with synced audio.

Add “AI voice” exploration (text-to-speech models).

Per-mode audio stingers (BTC beep, GW glitch, JD calm tone).

Nostr + Lightning Integration

App runs as a Nostr account (JD Colonel persona).

Replies to zaps/comments in-character.

Lightning QR donation embed in UI.

Platform Expansion

iOS build via Expo EAS.

Android version (Expo Bare workflow).

Deploy Worker + frontend for public beta (controlled key).

Funding Sustainability

Lightning donations → API credits.

Token usage transparency (“X tokens used this session”).

Optional paywall for heavy use.

Mid-Term Explorations

Security Hardening

Prompt sandboxing (strip URLs/JS injection).

Hardened API gateway with IP-based risk checks.

Advanced Mode Expansions

New personalities (Campbell, Rose, Otacon).

Hybrid “Nostradamus” mode: real-time news + prophetic AI tone.

AI as Character

Fetch from MGS fandom wiki + weave into replies.

Narrative memory per session (track user’s “arc”).

Stretch Vision

Community Testing: Friends can hit a hosted demo with temporary keys.

Public Beta: Deploy on a .app domain, user-limited free tier.

Integration with Games: Possible modding layer → codec overlay in streaming.
